Hi, I'm Adam, I'm learning to code and currently studying at [Founders and Coders](http://foundersandcoders.org) (check them out, it's the future of education). This is a place for my thoughts, learnings, and sporadic insights. Commence Blog!

Having just built a Jekyll [site](http://codedependentfc.github.io) from scratch (with my redoubtable team at F&C), I thought I'd luxuriate in a pre-built theme. This is [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde), and it's pretty sweet. I have a feeling I'm going to learn a lot about responsive design from digging around in this code, media queries galore...

Thoughts after the first week:

* Git(Hub) is amazing, but a source of profound and terrible confusion. Fear the merge conflict!
* Jekyll is like a cool drink of water after a year in the Wordpress desert.
* I miss Ruby, but Javascript has a certain ragamuffin charm. I think it's growing on me...
* Markdown makes me never want to see another angle bracket again. But, I am resigned to the fact that I must.
